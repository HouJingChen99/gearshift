# gearshift
Clutch/gearbox simulation for rFactor 2 in particular.

Inspired by the "Grinding Tranny Mod" (http://www.richardjackett.com/grindingtranny) this is monitors a shifter and clutch and if a gear change is not done with the clutch pressed it repeatedly sends a "Neutral" key press to prevent the gear being selected and sounds a graunching noise.

Nothing is specific to rFactor, gearshift will work with other games.

# Installing
Download gearshift.exe, Configurer.exe and Grind_default.wav to a folder on your PC.

Run Configurer.exe to set up for your shifter and pedals (that creates gearshift.ini).

Once configured, run gearshift.exe then start rFactor 2.  In rF2 set the Neutral control to Numpad 0 - if you try to select a gear without the clutch pressed gearshift will send Numpad 0 repeatedly to stop rFactor selecting the gear, it will also make the sound of the gears grinding.

# gearbox
Clutch/gearbox simulation for rFactor 2 in particular.

Inspired by the "Grinding Tranny Mod" (http://www.richardjackett.com/grindingtranny) this is monitors a shifter and clutch and if a gear change is not done with the clutch pressed it repeatedly sends a "Neutral" key press to prevent the gear being selected and sounds a graunching noise.

Run Configurer.exe to set up for your shifter and pedals (that creates gearshift.ini).

Once configured, run gearshift.exe then start rFactor 2.  Set the Neutral control to Numpad 0 - if you try to select a gear without the clutch pressed gearshift will send Numpad 0 repeatedly to stop rFactor selecting the gear, it will also make the sound of the gears grinding.

Nothing is specific to rFactor, gearshift will work with other games.
